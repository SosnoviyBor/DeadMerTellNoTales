# Dead Mer Tell No Tales (OpenMW)

When an NPC dies or disappears, they no longer own anything.

Killing an NPC or making them disappear (via quest or `disable` command) removes their ownership over anything they previously owned: items, containers, activators (like beds), doors, etc. Excludes guards!

Go, do a crime.

*Indirectly allows you to legally obtain several player homes throughout the game - even as early as your first arrival in Seyda Neen.*

## Compatibility

The mod assumes everyone is unique. If you have two NPCs with the same ID (including those created via the `placeatpc` command), killing one will remove ownership regardless of whether the other is alive.

Installing mid-playthrough won't update ownership for NPCs who are already dead (can be fixed by using `placeatpc` command). Ownership also won't revert to its initial state after uninstalling the mod.

### Incompatible mods

- [Go Home!](https://modding-openmw.gitlab.io/go-home/) - Adding compatibility for it is planned, but for now you can disable the "Record Disabled Actors" option. Note that this will ignore actors disabled by quests too.
