# Dead Mer Tell No Tales (OpenMW)

When an NPC dies, they no longer own anything.

For an MWSE alternative, check out [MWSE Disown the Departed](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55315) by **Pherim**.

Killing an NPC removes their ownership over anything they previously owned: items, containers, activators (like beds), doors, etc.

Go, do a crime.

## Requirements

OpenMW, duh.

## Installation

Install like any other OpenMW mod.

## Compatibility

The mod assumes everyone is unique. If you have two NPCs with the same ID (including those created via the `placeatpc` command), killing one will remove ownership regardless of whether the other is alive.

Installing mid-playthrough won’t update ownership for NPCs who are already dead. Ownership also won’t revert to its initial state after uninstalling the mod.
